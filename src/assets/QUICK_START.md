# 🎬 Quick Start: Adding Your Aurora Video

## Option 1: Free Stock Videos (Recommended)

### Pexels (Free, No Attribution Required)
1. Visit: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/aurora%20borealis%20forest/
2. Download a video (1920x1080 or higher)
3. Rename it to: `aurora-background.mp4`
4. Place it in: `src/assets/aurora-background.mp4`

### Pixabay (Free, No Attribution Required)
1. Visit: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/northern%20lights/
2. Download a video
3. Rename to: `aurora-background.mp4`
4. Place in: `src/assets/`

## Option 2: Use a Gradient (No Video Needed)

The site already has a beautiful gradient fallback! If you don't have a video yet, the landing page will show a purple-pink-blue gradient instead.

## Video Specifications

**Ideal Specs:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- Duration: 30-60 seconds (will loop)
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- File Size: Under 10MB (compress if needed)
- Content: Aurora borealis over a forest/nature scene at night

## Compress Your Video (If Too Large)

### Using Online Tool
1. Visit: https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor
2. Upload your video
3. Set quality to "Medium" or "Small file size"
4. Download and rename to `aurora-background.mp4`

### Using FFmpeg (Command Line)
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec h264 -b:v 2000k -acodec aac -b:a 128k aurora-background.mp4
```

## Testing

After adding the video:
1. Save the file in `src/assets/aurora-background.mp4`
2. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:5173/)
3. The landing page hero should now show your video!

## Troubleshooting

**Video not showing?**
- Check the filename is exactly: `aurora-background.mp4` (no spaces, lowercase)
- Ensure it's in `src/assets/` folder
- Try refreshing the browser with Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- Check browser console for errors

**Video too large/slow?**
- Compress it using the methods above
- Target file size: 3-8MB
